    <h1>Dark Souls Series</h1>
    <p>Dark souls series or as fans like to call them "Souls born games" are action role-playing games that are played
        in 3rd person.</p>
    <p>The most appealing thing about these games is their difficulty and how can you overcome the challenges they
        present, this is also a birth place of Git gud meme. Something is tough you just need to get better. This games
        doesn't hold your hand, you need to figure stuff on your own.
    </p>
    <p>In the game as you start you are promted to choose from few classes, those can range from melee classes to
        magical ones.
    </p>
    <p>Here are a few ones that are a good to start the game with:</p>
    <ul>
        <h3>
            <li>Knight <a href="./knight.html"> click me for images</a></li>
        </h3>
        <p>You can get a head start on good gear with this one and is recommended for starting players.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Assassin <a href="./assassin.html"> click me for images</a></li>
        </h3>
        <p>If you like to play fast and want to be quck on your feet this is the class for you, you have quck attacks
            but the ofset is that the damage dealt is not that good</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Sorcerer <a href="./sorcerer.html"> click me for images</a></li>
        </h3>
        <p>If you want to play the game on easy this is the one to start with, you have all the good persk, you can
            attack from distance and also deal good damage. But the downside is that if something hits you, you can say
            goodbye to at least half of your health.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Deprived <a href="./deprived.html"> click me for images</a></li>
        </h3>
        <p>This one is only for you if you hate yourself and like to challenge yourself. That's why I love to play as
            this class, I can start with a clean slate and get the character stats the way I want, you only get a club
            and a wooden wanna be shield.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>To sum this game up. It's a game that you either love or hate. If you are not good enough you just need to play
        more and then it will start to get easier and you start to kill the enemies and bosses with ease. </p>
