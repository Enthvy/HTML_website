    <h1>Forza horizon series</h1>
    <p>Forza horizon is a sub series of Forza games. There is the motorsport, much more realistic and non arcady. And
        the Horizon which is more arcady and more fun in my opinion for someone who just wants to turn on the game and
        just drive around care free. </p>
    <p>In forza games you can use all kind of peripherals, keyboard, gamepad, drive wheel with gear stick and peddals,
        that's where the best experience lies, that is when you get used to the controlls.
    </p>
    <p>Forza Horizon games are kings at making a big open world maps that are filled with interesting vistas, terrain
        and locations. in particular the newest addition to the series 5 is set in Mexico. It has stunning views and the
        dynamic weather system makes it so much more lively and emmersive. <a href="./weather.html">click for

    <p>The one in 4 makes you go through all 4 seasons. <a href="./forzahorizon4season.html">click for
            images.</a> All seasons and wather conditions do make the game more difficult or easier. For example if you
        are in winter and it starts snowing and the snow piles up, you car starts to loose traction and startds to slide
        on the road, it's difficult to keep yourself on the track.</p>
    <p>But to counteract this you can tune up your car to your preferences or the track preferences. There are a lot of
        geeks that like to fine-tune their cars exactly how they need it.</p>
    <p>That also brings me to big part of the game wich is <strong>Car customization.</strong> You can customize almost
        everything in this game from how the car looks the color to the bumpers windows, wheels and much more. <a

    <p>To sum it up. Forza Horizon is a really compelling gome that I like to play when I just wanna drive a car even tho I don't have a drivers licsene.</p>
